# ssl_test
Project Purple Cow
This function checks the expiration date on ssl certs. 
the documentation i used to create and run this function is from:
	https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws/lambda-api-gateway
	https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-handler.html
	https://fitdevops.in/monitoring-alerting-of-ssl-certificate-expiry/

I built this function off of already existing code and just tailored it for this specific task.
